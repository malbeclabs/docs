## Prerequisites
!!! warning inline end
    DoubleZero needs to be installed directly on your validator host, not in a container.
- x86_64 server running Ubuntu or Rocky (doublezero uses minimal system resources and should run with no issue on any modern bare metal machine)
- Internet connectivity with a public IP address (no NAT)
- Your host firewall must allow inbound GRE (IP protocol 47) and BGP (TCP port 179).
- Solana CLI (optional)
- If you are running Firedancer, you will need to add the following to your `config.toml` file on version v0.502.20212 or higher. (No additional configuration is required for Agave and Jito.)
```
[net]
    provider = "socket"
```

### Validator configuration

## Steps
### 1. Set up package repo
DoubleZero is an open source project hosted on GitHub. Releases are built into binaries that are pushed to Cloudsmith.io, which distributes the binaries for both Debian-flavor and RedHat-flavor Linux systems. Add the repository to your system using the appropriate commands below for your operating system:

Ubuntu / Debian:
```
curl -1sLf \
  https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/malbeclabs/doublezero/setup.deb.sh \
  | sudo -E bash
```
Rocky / Redhat:
```
curl -1sLf \
  https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/malbeclabs/doublezero/setup.rpm.sh \
  | sudo -E bash
```

### 2. Install or upgrade doublezero
!!! tip inline end
    After this step you can perform doublezero read operations, such as `doublezero user list`.

Now that we have the repo set up, we can install DoubleZero and start the DoubleZero daemon process (doublezerod) using the appropriate commands below for your operating system:

#### 2.1 Ubuntu / Debian

First time install:
```
sudo apt-get install doublezero=0.2.2-1
```

Upgrade:
```
sudo apt upgrade doublezero=0.2.2-1
```

#### 2.2 Rocky / RHEL

First time install:
```
sudo yum install doublezero-0.2.2
```

Upgrade:
```
sudo yum update doublezero-0.2.2
```

### 3. Check the status of `doublezerod`
After the package is installed, a new systemd unit is installed, activated and started.  To see the status:

```
sudo systemctl status doublezerod
```

To see the doublezerod logs, look in the journal:
```
sudo journalctl -u doublezerod
```

### 4. Create doublezero config directory
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/doublezero
```

### 5. Verify that doublezero is talking to the correct Solana cluster
```
doublezero config get
```

Expected result:
```
Config File: /home/ubuntu/.config/doublezero/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://doublezerolocalnet.rpcpool.com/f50e62d0-06e7-410e-867e-6873e358ed30
WebSocket URL: wss://doublezerolocalnet.rpcpool.com/f50e62d0-06e7-410e-867e-6873e358ed30/whirligig (computed)
Keypair Path: /home/ubuntu/.config/doublezero/id.json
Program ID: DZtnuQ839pSaDMFG5q1ad2V95G82S5EC4RrB3Ndw2Heb
```

### 6. Add your Solana id.json to the doublezero config directory and check balance
Copy or link the `id.json` you want to use with DoubleZero to the doublezero config directory.
```
sudo cp </path/to/id.json> ~/.config/doublezero/
```

Check that you've copied or linked the expected pubkey.
```
doublezero address
```

For DoubleZero testnet, DoubleZero's smartcontract is deployed in a Solana Permissioned Environment (SPE) hosted on rpcpool.com. In order to interact with the DoubleZero ledger, you need SOL for transaction fees. If you find a zero balance, please see the next step.

```
doublezero balance
```

Sample output:
```
$ doublezero balance
1.9981754 SOL
```

### 7. Contact DZF to have your pubkey added to the allowlist
!!! note inline end
	To check if your pubkey is already in the allowlist, use `doublezero user allowlist list | grep <your_pubkey>`

DoubleZero testnet is currently in a permissioned mode.  In order to connect, your pubkey must be present in the allowlist which is managed by the DoubleZero Foundation.

If your pubkey is not in the allowlist, please reach out to the [DoubleZero Foundation](https://doublezero.xyz).
Once allowlisted, you will also notice that the ```doublezero balance``` is non-zero. If you still see a zero balance please reach out to the [DoubleZero Foundation](https://doublezero.xyz).

### 8. Check that doublezerod has discovered DZ devices
Before connecting, be sure `doublezerod` has discovered and pinged each of the available DZ testnet switches:
```
doublezero latency
```
Sample output:
```
$ doublezero latency
 pubkey                                       | name      | ip             | min      | max      | avg      | reachable

```
If no devices are returned in the output, wait 10-20 seconds and retry.

### 9. Connect

This step signs a doublezero smart contract and connects the system to the lowest-latency doublezero node available. DoubleZero has two modes available currently: IBRL and Multicast.

NOTE: As of v0.2.0, only a single tunnel can be provisioned at a time.

#### IBRL Mode
```
doublezero connect ibrl
```
You should see output similar to the following:
```
$ doublezero connect ibrl
DoubleZero Service Provisioning
ð  Start Provisioning User...
    Get your Public IP: <Your public IP> (If you want to specify a particular address, use the argument --client-ip x.x.x.x)
ð  Provisioning User for IP: <Your public IP>
    Creating an account for the IP: <Your public IP>
    The Device has been selected: <selected DoubleZero device IP>
    User activated with dz_ip: <Your public IP>
Provisioning: status: ok
/  Connected
```

<details>
<summary>Multicast Mode</summary>

Multicast mode has both a `publisher` and a `subscriber` role. The publisher sends out packets across the network and subscribers are those who receive packets originating from the publisher.

NOTE: As of v0.2.0, a user can be only a subscriber or a publisher. If a user wishes to change their subscription or become a publisher, they'll have to disconnect and reconnect.

##### Publisher

```
 doublezero --keypair $SOLANA_KEYPAIR connect multicast publisher <multicast_group> --client-ip <client_ip>
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```

ð  Start Provisioning User...
    Using Public IP: <Your public IP>
ð  Provisioning User for IP: <Your public IP>
    Creating an account for the IP: <Your public IP>
    The Device has been selected: <selected DoubleZero device IP>
|  Waiting for user activation..
    User activated with dz_ip: <Your public IP>
    Provisioning: status: ok
/  Connected
```

You should also notice the `publishers` column count increase by one.

```
doublezero multicast group list

```

##### Subscriber

```
  doublezero --keypair $SOLANA_KEYPAIR connect multicast subscriber <multicast_group> --client-ip <client_ip>
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
ð  Start Provisioning User...

|  Waiting for user activation...
    User activated with dz_ip: <Your public IP>
    Provisioning: status: ok
/  Connected
```

You should also see the number of `subscribers` increase by one.

```
doublezero multicast group list
```

```

</details>

Congratulations, your DoubleZero connection is up and running! We hope. Let's run a few more commands to make sure everything is working.

### 10. Verify doublezero tunnel

#### IBRL mode
```
doublezero status
```

Expected result:

```
 Tunnel status | Last Session Update | Tunnel Name | Tunnel src       | Tunnel dst      | Doublezero IP     | User Type

```
</details>

### 11. Verify routing link address in routing table

#### IBRL
```
ip route show dev doublezero0
```
You should see a variable number of routes marked with "proto bgp", and a single 169.254/31 route.
```
$ ip route show dev doublezero0
<DZ User X's IP> via 169.254.0.2 proto bgp src <DZ User X's IP>
<DZ User Y's IP> via 169.254.0.2 proto bgp src <DZ User Y's IP>
169.254.0.2/31 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.3
```
<details>
<summary>Multicast</summary>

##### Publisher
```
$ ip route show dev doublezero1
```

```
169.254.0.0/31 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.1
<multicast_ip> via 169.254.0.0 proto static src 64.86.249.81
```

##### Subscriber

```
$ ip route show dev doublezero1
```

You should see a variable number of routes marked with "proto static", and a single 169.254/31 route. Note that for subscribers, the `src` is empty.

```
