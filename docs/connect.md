In the event of actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section or the licenses contained herein, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it. User is responsible for maintaining the Solution and the secrecy of any passwords, seed phrases, or codes that provide access to the Solution as the Confidential Information of DZF. Nothing herein limits or restricts DZF's right or ability to use data regarding the performance, availability, usage, integrity and security of the Solution. If either party breaches, or threatens to breach the provisions of this Section 5, each party agrees that the non-breaching party will have no adequate remedy at law and is therefore entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual money damages.

    <span style="font-size:14px;">6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;">6.1 ^^WARRANTY DISCLAIMER^^.</span> THE SOLUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

    <span style="font-size:14px;">7. GOVERNING LAW.</span>
    This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed, interpreted and constructed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands. Should a controversy, dispute or claim arise out of or in relation to this Agreement ("Dispute"), the relevant party as appropriate, must give 30 days' notice of such Dispute to the other parties (the "Notice of Dispute"). Should the Dispute not be resolved at the expiration of 30 days after service of the Notice of Dispute, the relevant party may commence arbitration proceedings as provided herein. Should the Dispute remain at the expiration of 30 days after service of the Notice of Dispute, the Dispute shall be settled by arbitration administered by the Cayman International Mediation & Arbitration Centre (CI-MAC) in accordance with the CI-MAC Arbitration Rules (the "Arbitration Rules") in force as at the date of this Agreement, which Arbitration Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference to this clause, and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended). The arbitration shall be seated in George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and governed by Cayman Islands law. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitration shall be determined by a sole arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Any award or decision made by the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties without any right of appeal, and judgment upon any award thus obtained may be entered in or enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof. No action at law or in equity based upon any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be instituted in any court of any jurisdiction. If any litigation or arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to have their attorney fees paid by the other party. Each party waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance herewith. </span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;">8. GENERAL PROVISIONS.</span>
    This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned by User without the prior written consent of DZF. DZF may freely assign this Agreement. All notices required to be sent hereunder shall be sent by email (to DZF: legal@doublezero.xyz) and deemed received the day after sending (with transmission confirmed). If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to acts of God, earthquakes, shortages of supplies, transportation difficulties, labor disputes, riots, war, fire, epidemics, and similar occurrences beyond its control, whether or not foreseeable. This Agreement together with any attachments constitutes the complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or oral, concerning the subject matter herein. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.

## Prerequisites
- x86_64 server running Ubuntu or Rocky (doublezero uses minimal system resources and should run with no issue on any modern bare metal machine)
- Internet connectivity with a public IP address (no NAT)
- Your host firewall must allow inbound GRE (IP protocol 47) and BGP (TCP port 179).
- Solana CLI (optional)
- A Solana account for use with DoubleZero, with a balance of at least 1 SOL - refer to Solana docs

## Steps
### 1. Set up apt repo
DoubleZero is an open source project hosted on GitHub. Releases are built into binaries that are pushed to Cloudsmith.io, which distributes the binaries for both Debian-flavor and RedHat-flavor Linux systems. Add the repository to your system using the appropriate commands below for your operating system:

Ubuntu / Debian:
```
curl -1sLf \
  https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/malbeclabs/doublezero/setup.deb.sh \
  | sudo -E bash
```
Rocky / Redhat:
```
curl -1sLf \
  https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/malbeclabs/doublezero/setup.rpm.sh \
  | sudo -E bash
```

### 2. Install doublezero
!!! note inline end
    After this step you can perform doublezero read operations, such as `doublezero device list`.

Now that we have the repo set up, we can install DoubleZero and start the DoubleZero daemon process (doublezerod) using the appropriate commands below for your operating system:

Ubuntu / Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install doublezero=0.0.19-1
```
Rocky / Redhat:
```
sudo yum install doublezero-0.0.19
```

After the package is installed, a new systemd unit is installed, activated and started.  To see the status:

```
sudo systemctl status doublezerod
```

To see the doublezerod logs, look in the journal:
```
sudo journalctl -u doublezerod
```


### 3. Create doublezero config directory
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/doublezero
```

### 4. Copy your Solana id.json to the doublezero config directory.
The smart contract program for DoubleZero testnet is installed on Solana devnet. In order to interact with the DoubleZero smart contract your Solana devnet will need >= 0 SOL. In the steps below please ensure you're using a keypair with devnet SOL.

Copy the `id.json` associated with your Solana devnet keypair to the config directory.
```
cp </path/to/id.json> ~/.config/doublezero 
```

### 5. Verify that doublezero is talking to the correct Solana cluster and verify your balance
```
doublezero config get

```

Expected result:
```
Config File: /home/ubuntu/.config/doublezero/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com
Keypair Path: "/home/ubuntu/.config/doublezero/id.json" 
```

Verify your balance:
```
doublezero balance
```


### 6. Connect
!!! note inline end
    Replace [MY_CLIENT_IP] with your server's publicly routable IP address which you can obtain using `ip address show`

This step signs a doublezero smart contract and connects the system to the lowest-latency doublezero node available.
```
sudo doublezero connect --client-ip [MY_CLIENT_IP]
```

Congratulaions, your DoubleZero connection is up and running! We hope. Let's run a few more commands to make sure everything is working.

### 7. Verify tunnel interface
!!! note end inline
    This will be replaced by a `doublezero status` CLI command.
```
ip link show doublezero0
```
Expected result: Interface details like IP address

Error result: `Device "doublezero0" does not exist`

### 8. Verify routing link address in routing table
!!! note end inline
    This will be replaced by a `doublezero status` CLI command.
```
ip route show dev doublezero0
```
Expected result: `169.254.0.12/31 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.13`

Note that the actual IP assignments will differ, but all addresses should be assigned from the link local range as originally proposed in RFC3927.
