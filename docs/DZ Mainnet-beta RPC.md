# How to connect to DoubleZero in IBRL Mode - for RPC nodes
!!! warning "By connecting to DoubleZero I agree to the [DoubleZero Terms of Service](https://doublezero.xyz/terms-protocol)"



###  Connecting to Mainnet-Beta in IBRL Mode

!!! Note inline end
    IBRL mode does not require restarting validator clients, because it uses your existing public IP address.

RPCs will complete connection to DoubleZero Mainnet-beta, which is detailed on this page.

## 1. Environment Configuration

Please follow the [setup](setup.md) instructions before proceeding.

The last step in setup was to disconnect from the network. This is to ensure that only one tunnel is open on your machine to DoubleZero, and that tunnel is on the correct network.


To configure the DoubleZero Client CLI (`doublezero`) and daemon (`doublezerod`) to connect to **DoubleZero mainnet-beta**:
```bash
DESIRED_DOUBLEZERO_ENV=mainnet-beta \
	&& sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/doublezerod.service.d \
	&& echo -e "[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/bin/doublezerod -sock-file /run/doublezerod/doublezerod.sock -env $DESIRED_DOUBLEZERO_ENV" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/doublezerod.service.d/override.conf > /dev/null \
	&& sudo systemctl daemon-reload \
	&& sudo systemctl restart doublezerod \
	&& doublezero config set --env $DESIRED_DOUBLEZERO_ENV  > /dev/null \
	&& echo "‚úÖ doublezerod configured for environment $DESIRED_DOUBLEZERO_ENV"
```

You should see the following output:
```
‚úÖ doublezerod configured for environment mainnet-beta
```

After about 30 seconds you will see the DoubleZero devices available:

```bash
doublezero latency
```

Testnet output will be identical in structure, but with many more available devices.

## 2. Contact the DoubleZero Foundation

The DoubleZero foundation. You will need to provide your `DoubleZeroID`, your `Validator ID` (node ID), and the `public ipv4 address` you will be connecting from.


## 3. Connect in IBRL Mode

On the server, with the user which will connect to DoubleZero, run the `connect` command to establish the connection to DoubleZero.

```bash
doublezero connect ibrl
```

You should see output indicating provisioning, such as:

```
DoubleZero Service Provisioning
üîó  Start Provisioning User...
Public IP detected: 137.184.101.183 - If you want to use a different IP, you can specify it with `--client-ip x.x.x.x`
üîç  Provisioning User for IP: 137.184.101.183
    User account created
    Connected to device: nyc-dz001
    The user has been successfully activated
    Service provisioned with status: ok
‚úÖ  User Provisioned
```
Wait one minute for the tunnel to complete. Until the tunnel is completed, your status output may return "down" or "Unknown" 

Verify your connection:

```bash
doublezero status
```

**Output:**
```bash
Tunnel status | Last Session Update     | Tunnel Name | Tunnel src      | Tunnel dst   | DoubleZero IP   | User Type
up            | 2025-09-10 12:16:03 UTC | doublezero0 | 137.184.101.183 | 64.86.249.22 | 137.184.101.183 | IBRL
```
A status of `up` means you are successfully connected.

You will be able to view routes propagated by other users on DoubleZero by running:

```
ip route
```
