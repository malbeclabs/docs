However, either party may disclose Confidential Information to its personnel, attorneys, and other representatives who have a need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and as required by law (in which case the receiving party will provide the disclosing party with prior notice thereof and opportunity to contest such disclosure, and will minimize such disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable law). The obligations of confidentiality in this Section 5 shall not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes generally known or publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was properly known to the receiving party, without restriction, prior to disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) was properly disclosed to the receiving party, without restriction, by another person with the legal authority to do so; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information. Each party agrees to exercise due care in protecting the Confidential Information of the other party from unauthorized use and disclosure. In the event of actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section or the licenses contained herein, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it. User is responsible for maintaining the Solution and the secrecy of any passwords, seed phrases, or codes that provide access to the Solution as the Confidential Information of DZF. Nothing herein limits or restricts DZF's right or ability to use data regarding the performance, availability, usage, integrity and security of the Solution. If either party breaches, or threatens to breach the provisions of this Section 5, each party agrees that the non-breaching party will have no adequate remedy at law and is therefore entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual money damages.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to acts of God, earthquakes, shortages of supplies, transportation difficulties, labor disputes, riots, war, fire, epidemics, and similar occurrences beyond its control, whether or not foreseeable. This Agreement together with any attachments constitutes the complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or oral, concerning the subject matter herein. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.

### 1. Connect Multicast Mode
DoubleZero Multicast Mode enables development teams like Anza, Firedancer and Jito to bring multicast publishers and subscribers on to the DoubleZero testnet. Multicast mode has both a `publisher` and a `subscriber` role. The publisher sends out packets across the network and subscribers are those who receive packets originating from the publisher.

Please follow the [setup](setup.md) instructions before proceeding.

!!! note inline end 
    As of v0.2.0, only a single tunnel can be provisioned at a time. In addition, a user can be only a subscriber or a publisher. If you want to switch between publisher or subscriber, you'll have to disconnect and reconnect.

#### Publisher

```
 doublezero --keypair $SOLANA_KEYPAIR connect multicast publisher <multicast_group> --client-ip <client_ip>
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```

ð  Start Provisioning User...
    Using Public IP: <Your public IP>
ð  Provisioning User for IP: <Your public IP>
    Creating an account for the IP: <Your public IP>
    The Device has been selected: <selected DoubleZero device IP>
|  Waiting for user activation..
    User activated with dz_ip: <Your public IP>
    Provisioning: status: ok
/  Connected
```

You should also notice the `publishers` column count increase by one.

```
doublezero multicast group list
```

```
 account                                      | code | multicast_ip | max_bandwidth | publishers | subscribers | status    | owner

```

#### Subscriber

```
  doublezero --keypair $SOLANA_KEYPAIR connect multicast subscriber <multicast_group> --client-ip <client_ip>
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
ð  Start Provisioning User...
    Using Public IP: <Your public IP>
ð  Provisioning User for IP: <Your public IP>
    Creating an account for the IP: <Your public IP>
    The Device has been selected: <selected DoubleZero device IP>
|  Waiting for user activation...
    User activated with dz_ip: <Your public IP>
    Provisioning: status: ok
/  Connected
```

You should also see the number of `subscribers` increase by one.

```

```


Congratulations, your DoubleZero connection is up and running! We hope. Let's run a few more commands to make sure everything is working.

### 2. Verify doublezero tunnel

#### Publisher
```
doublezero status
```

Expected result:

```
 Tunnel status | Last Session Update | Tunnel Name | Tunnel src       | Tunnel dst      | Doublezero IP     | User Type
 up            | <Timestamp>         | doublezero1 | <Your public IP> | <Doublezero IP> | <Your public IP>  | Multicast
```


#### Subscriber
```
doublezero status
```

Expected result:

```
 Tunnel status | Last Session Update | Tunnel Name | Tunnel src       | Tunnel dst      | Doublezero IP | User Type
 up            | <Timestamp>         | doublezero1 | <Your public IP> | <Doublezero IP> |               | Multicast
```

### 3. Verify routing link address in routing table

In multicast mode, you should see a single 169.254/31 route, plus a static route for the multicast group you are connected to. 

#### Publisher
```
$ ip route show dev doublezero1
```

```
169.254.0.0/31 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.1
<multicast_ip> via 169.254.0.0 proto static src 64.86.249.81
```

#### Subscriber

```
$ ip route show dev doublezero1
```

```
169.254.0.0/31 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.1
<multicast_ip> via 169.254.0.0 proto static
```
