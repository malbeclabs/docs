# New Tenant

If you are interested in connecting to DoubleZero as a new tenant, such as a blockchain not currently supported by the DoubleZero network, you must speak with a member of the DoubleZero team.

You can submit a form at the link below to provide details on the tenant request, including name, title, reasons for connection request, types of users (i.e. RPC, validators, nodes) and ideal timeline. We can discuss strategy and approach to align on the best path forward and ensure there is good fit.
