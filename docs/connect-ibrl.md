    <span style="font-size:14px;">4. TERM AND TERMINATION.</span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;">4.1 ^^Term^^.</span> This Agreement will commence as of the Effective Date and will remain in full force and effect for the Evaluation Period. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately for convenience, for any reason or no reason, upon written notice to the other party (email to suffice).

    <span style="font-size:14px;">4.1 ^^Effects of Termination^^.</span> Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason: (i) the rights granted to User hereunder will immediately terminate; (ii) User shall immediately discontinue any use of the Solution and shall return or destroy all Documentation and any DZ Software under its control; (iii) each party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information and property of the other party; and (iv) Sections 2.2, 2.3, 3, 4.2, and 5 through 8 will survive.

    <span style="font-size:14px;">5. CONFIDENTIALITY.</span>
    Each party agrees that it will use the Confidential Information of the other party solely to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement and it will not disclose, or permit to be disclosed, the same, except as otherwise permitted hereunder. However, either party may disclose Confidential Information to its personnel, attorneys, and other representatives who have a need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and as required by law (in which case the receiving party will provide the disclosing party with prior notice thereof and opportunity to contest such disclosure, and will minimize such disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable law). The obligations of confidentiality in this Section 5 shall not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes generally known or publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was properly known to the receiving party, without restriction, prior to disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) was properly disclosed to the receiving party, without restriction, by another person with the legal authority to do so; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information. Each party agrees to exercise due care in protecting the Confidential Information of the other party from unauthorized use and disclosure. In the event of actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section or the licenses contained herein, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it. User is responsible for maintaining the Solution and the secrecy of any passwords, seed phrases, or codes that provide access to the Solution as the Confidential Information of DZF. Nothing herein limits or restricts DZF's right or ability to use data regarding the performance, availability, usage, integrity and security of the Solution. If either party breaches, or threatens to breach the provisions of this Section 5, each party agrees that the non-breaching party will have no adequate remedy at law and is therefore entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual money damages.

    <span style="font-size:14px;">6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;">6.1 ^^WARRANTY DISCLAIMER^^.</span> THE SOLUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

    <span style="font-size:14px;">7. GOVERNING LAW.</span>
    This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed, interpreted and constructed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands. Should a controversy, dispute or claim arise out of or in relation to this Agreement ("Dispute"), the relevant party as appropriate, must give 30 days' notice of such Dispute to the other parties (the "Notice of Dispute"). Should the Dispute not be resolved at the expiration of 30 days after service of the Notice of Dispute, the relevant party may commence arbitration proceedings as provided herein. Should the Dispute remain at the expiration of 30 days after service of the Notice of Dispute, the Dispute shall be settled by arbitration administered by the Cayman International Mediation & Arbitration Centre (CI-MAC) in accordance with the CI-MAC Arbitration Rules (the "Arbitration Rules") in force as at the date of this Agreement, which Arbitration Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference to this clause, and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended).

The arbitration shall be determined by a sole arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Any award or decision made by the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties without any right of appeal, and judgment upon any award thus obtained may be entered in or enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof. No action at law or in equity based upon any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be instituted in any court of any jurisdiction. If any litigation or arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to have their attorney fees paid by the other party. Each party waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance herewith. </span>

    <span style="font-size:14px;">8. GENERAL PROVISIONS.</span>
    This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned by User without the prior written consent of DZF. DZF may freely assign this Agreement. All notices required to be sent hereunder shall be sent by email (to DZF: legal@doublezero.xyz) and deemed received the day after sending (with transmission confirmed). If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to acts of God, earthquakes, shortages of supplies, transportation difficulties, labor disputes, riots, war, fire, epidemics, and similar occurrences beyond its control, whether or not foreseeable. This Agreement together with any attachments constitutes the complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or oral, concerning the subject matter herein. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.



### 1. Connect IBRL Mode

Note that connecting in IBRL mode does not require restarting the Jito or Agave clients because your existing public IP is advertised to DoubleZero so that other users on DoubleZero will route via the DoubleZero network when sending to your validator. Likewise, the routes received from DoubleZero and installed in the kernel routing table cause your validator to send to other DoubleZero-enabled validators over the DoubleZero network.

Please follow the [setup](setup.md) instructions before proceeding.

!!! note inline end
    As of v0.2.0, only a single tunnel can be provisioned at a time.
```
doublezero connect ibrl
```
You should see output similar to the following:
```
$ doublezero connect ibrl
DoubleZero Service Provisioning
🔗  Start Provisioning User...
    Get your Public IP: <Your public IP> (If you want to specify a particular address, use the argument --client-ip x.x.x.x)
🔍  Provisioning User for IP: <Your public IP>
    Creating an account for the IP: <Your public IP>
    The Device has been selected: <selected DoubleZero device IP>
    User activated with dz_ip: <Your public IP>
Provisioning: status: ok
/  Connected
```

Congratulations, your DoubleZero connection is up and running! We hope. Let's run a few more commands to make sure everything is working.

### 2. Verify doublezero tunnel

```
doublezero status
```

Expected result:

```
 Tunnel status | Last Session Update | Tunnel Name | Tunnel src       | Tunnel dst      | Doublezero IP     | User Type
 up            | <Timestamp>         | doublezero0 | <Your public IP> | <Doublezero IP> | <Your public IP>  | IBRL
```

### 3. Verify routing link address in routing table

```
ip route show dev doublezero0
```
You should see a variable number of routes marked with "proto bgp", and a single 169.254/31 route.
```
$ ip route show dev doublezero0
<DZ User X's IP> via 169.254.0.2 proto bgp src <DZ User X's IP>
<DZ User Y's IP> via 169.254.0.2 proto bgp src <DZ User Y's IP>
169.254.0.2/31 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.3
```

### 4. Check Latency

```
doublezero latency
```
You should see the nearest DoubleZero devices, and your latency to them.
```
