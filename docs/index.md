# Welcome to DoubleZero

DoubleZero is a decentralized framework for creating and managing high-performance decentralized networks, optimized for distributed systems like blockchains. Users of DoubleZero enjoy an integrated service for highly-optimized transmission and pre-processing for distributed systems data.

## Who is DoubleZero for?

### Contributors

DoubleZero contributors have network capacity in the form of underutilized private fiber links and hardware (e.g. switches and FPGA devices). Configuring these resources to extend the DoubleZero network creates an integrated information service. Using the DZ protocol, network contributors stitch this network capacity into a dynamic and expansive global mesh network and receive token incentives for their contribution.

### Users

DoubleZero users participate in distributed systems, such as blockchains, that require high-performance network connectivity. Interconnecting a blockchain system with DoubleZero, users gain a bundling of optimization features to accelerate their network I/O.

In its initial implementation, the DoubleZero network is compatible with blockchain validator clients as well as RPC and MEV infrastructure providers. These user systems undergo admission control by verifying their uniquely identifying public key addresses on their respective ledgers before allowing them access to the network. As the network evolves to include user systems from other ecosystems, additional identification and authentication strategies will be added tailored to each user project community.

## Benefits

The only alternative to DoubleZero is the public internet. Compared to the public internet, the DoubleZero network offers two improvements to blockchains.

*First*, inbound transactions can be edge-filtered in a non-discretionary way at the network contributor hardware level (i.e. removal of spam and duplicates) prior to being sent over to users (e.g., blockchain nodes) of the DoubleZero network. This allows blockchains to benefit from shared system-wide filtration resources rather than needing each individual validator to provision sufficient resources. As a result, validators can reallocate their resources towards directly revenue-generating activities.

*Second*, outbound messages are routed more directly and prioritized to improve efficiency. This is possible since in DoubleZero the routing logic of global data movement is optimized for speed, unlike the public internet. Thus, validators benefit from reduced jitter, which is defined as the amount of variation in latency between two data cable endpoints. In essence, blockchain nodes can send and receive blocks faster.

Taken together, these DoubleZero network benefits can achieve levels of performance that are otherwise unobtainable via the public internet.
