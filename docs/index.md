# Welcome to DoubleZero

DoubleZero is a decentralized framework for creating and managing high-performance permissionless networks, optimized for distributed systems like blockchain. It enables permissionless contributions of underutilized private fiber links to create a dynamic and expansive network.

What are the benefits of connecting to DZ? Compared to the public internet, the DoubleZero network offers two improvements to blockchains. First, inbound transactions can be edge-filtered (i.e. removed of spam and duplicates) by specialized hardware prior to being sent over the DoubleZero network. This allows blockchains to benefit from shared system-wide filtration resources rather than needing each individual validator to provision sufficient resources. Second, outbound messages are routed more directly and prioritized to improve efficiency. Validators benefit from improved jitter, which is defined as the amount of variation in latency between two endpoints. Taken together, these DoubleZero network benefits can achieve levels of performance that are otherwise unobtainable without the centralized co-location of systems.
