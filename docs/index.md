# Welcome to DoubleZero

DoubleZero is a decentralized framework for creating and managing high-performance permissionless networks, optimized for distributed systems like blockchain. Users of DoubleZero enjoy an integrated service for highly-optimized transmission for distributed systems data.

## Who is DoubleZero for?

### Contributors

DoubleZero contributors have network capacity in the form of underutilized private fiber links. Using the DZ protocol, network contributors stitch this network capacity into a dynamic and expansive permissionless global network and receive token incentives for their contribution.

### Users

DoubleZero users have distributed system, such as blockchains, that require high-performance network connectivity. Interconnecting their systems with DoubleZero, users gain a bundling of optimization features to accelerate their network IO.

## Benefits

What are the benefits of connecting to DZ? Compared to the public internet, the DoubleZero network offers two improvements to blockchains. First, inbound transactions can be edge-filtered (i.e. removed of spam and duplicates) by specialized hardware prior to being sent over the DoubleZero network. This allows blockchains to benefit from shared system-wide filtration resources rather than needing each individual validator to provision sufficient resources. Second, outbound messages are routed more directly and prioritized to improve efficiency. Validators benefit from improved jitter, which is defined as the amount of variation in latency between two endpoints. Taken together, these DoubleZero network benefits can achieve levels of performance that are otherwise unobtainable without the centralized co-location of systems.
